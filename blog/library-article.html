            <div class="divide-y  divide-gray-700 xl:col-span-3 xl:row-span-2 xl:pb-0"><div class="prose prose-invert max-w-none pb-8 pt-10"><p>I went crazy for my local library because I wanted to ‚Äòvote with my actions‚Äô. When we borrow books we vote for the existence of libraries. When we borrow a specific book that we are really interested in, we vote for that book to be kept in stock and available to everyone. When we borrow from a specific genre, we ensure that the library knows it‚Äôs popular and wants to buy more of it, expanding the reading-options for the whole population.</p>
<p>A comment on Reddit inspired me to take action. It read: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre lucky libraries are an old invention: if the concept of free, almost unlimited knowledge, accessible to everyone, was invented today, the GOP would be against it‚Äù. Which is true - how many governments would really support libraries if they were invented today?</p>
<p>So, I began using my local library excessively. Books I have read have fundamentally changed my perspective and made me see myself, my relationships, our society, and humanity in a new way. I cannot imagine living without the epiphanies and expanded knowledge the books have given me.</p>
<p>Here‚Äôs my guide to getting the most out of your local library.</p>
<h2 id="navigating-denmarks-library-system">Navigating Denmark's Library System</h2>
<p>The Danish public libraries‚Äô website, <a href="https://bibliotek.dk">bibliotek.dk</a>, has forever changed the way I interact with Danish libraries. It‚Äôs a site containing an overview of the contents of all libraries in all of Denmark. You can order anything you‚Äôd like, and have it sent directly to a library where you are a registered borrower. Any book in all of Denmark‚Äôs libraries is accessible to you in a few clicks and will be delivered in a few days (or you will be put in a queue if other people have reserved it before you). You then just go to pick it up at your library. It is as easy to have books sent to your library as it is to borrow from your local one.</p>
<p>You can see all information related to your order on the website of the library you have it delivered to: your position in a potential queue, when the material has to be returned, and you can prolong the period where it is borrowed for up to three months plus your starter month if no one else has reserved it.</p>
<h2 id="why-i-chose-physical-books-over-ebooks">Why I Chose Physical Books Over Ebooks</h2>
<p>I was already reading quite a few books on my mobile because of a lack of a more convenient alternative. For several years the convenience was too great to give up this eye-straining medium.[1] When my vision started to deteriorate, I began borrowing from the library. Apart from the eye-strain, I wanted to switch from digital to analog because information is retained better when reading physical books compared to reading on a screen.[2] It turned into a healthy addiction.</p>
<p>I started with books recommended by a librarian, then I went for recommendations on the subreddit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/suggestmeabook/">r/suggestmeabook</a>, then I wanted to read books by and about women and then I wanted to read whatever I randomly felt like with no inhibitions. When I go to pick up books I often look at the titles other people have reserved to expand my horizon. I take book suggestions seriously and will read a book someone suggests to me and tell them about it afterwards, so they know their suggestion meant something to me.</p>
<p>I still use ebooks sometimes for titles I have already borrowed from my library due to the convenience of being able to copy and paste paragraphs and quotes from them. I mostly use paragraphs and quotes as notes to myself, but I also use them if I write a book review or for other reasons want to quote the book in an online forum or chat. Using a combination of physical books and ebooks are now the most healthy and convenient way to read books for me. I also want to get an e-reader so that when I do occasionally read an ebook, I can read it in the healthiest, non-eye straining way.</p>
<h2 id="borrow-ebooks-and-audiobooks-as-well">Borrow Ebooks and Audiobooks as Well</h2>
<p>Although there are now an extensive array of companies offering subscriptions for ebooks and audiobooks, people can still conveniently borrow ebooks and audiobooks from the library at no cost. I wonder how there can be such a huge market for something you can so easily get for free. Why not support our libraries instead? The only point I see for these paid subscriptions is if you cannot find a book on bibliotek.dk, nor will they purchase it upon request, and you are certain that a specific subscription-based book service offers it.</p>
<p>ereolen.dk is the Danish website to borrow ebooks and Danish audiobooks from. When you borrow an ebook, it will automatically be returned after one month, so you don‚Äôt have to remember to return it. For audiobooks in English, you can use the app Libby or the corresponding website <a href="https://libbyapp.com/shelf">libbyapp.com</a>.</p>
<h2 id="books-that-fundamentally-changed-my-perspective">Books That Fundamentally Changed My Perspective</h2>
<p>I take book suggestions very seriously and Reddit is one of the places I go to for them. Here are three fundamentally mind-changing books have I read that I recommend to others:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>&quot;Why Does He Do That?&quot; by Lundy Bancroft ‚Äì This book completely blew my mind unlike any other and fundamentally changed my view of domestic abuse and of our society. Bancroft is a very experienced abuse counselor and explains the minds of abusive men and debunks a lot of myths. The insights are unreal - there are so many ways that our society‚Äôs status quo views of domestic abuse, sexual attitudes, popular media, and views of gender take part in promoting male-on-female domestic- and sexual abuse and inadvertently protect male abusers. For instance, there are biases within the legal system and among psychologists that tend to side with abusive men while disbelieving female victims. Abusive behaviors are NOT caused by mental illness, addictions, low self-esteem, or having been abused as a child, but are caused by absorbing the abusive and misogynist attitudes of the man‚Äôs family and society at large. You will never overlook red flags after this one; it should be required reading for all women.</p>
</li>
<li><p>&quot;Come as You Are&quot; by Emily Nagoski ‚Äì This book scientifically explores sexuality with an emphasis on women‚Äôs experiences. It‚Äôs the perfect sex ed class. Nagoski introduces concepts like the dual-control model of sexual response and the importance of understanding one's personal sexual accelerators and brakes. Whole new concepts that I personally had never heard of before but which made sexual desire and response make sense on a whole new level. It also addresses the impact of stress, body image, and emotional connection on sexual health. It really changed the way I view sexuality.</p>
</li>
<li><p>&quot;How to Change Your Mind&quot; by Michael Pollan ‚Äì My fascination with psychedelics felt more socially acceptable after attending lectures on their neurological effects during my pharmacy education. So, while it wasn‚Äôt this book that blew my mind, it goes through the same science of psychedelics in more layman‚Äôs terms. It‚Äôs divided into three parts: the history of psychedelics, the neuroscience behind them, and Pollan‚Äôs personal experiences with psychedelic therapy. I can tell you based on the lectures that a study showed that a high dose of psilocybin in a clinically controlled setting is by very far the most effective antidepressant there is, and can cause a semi-permanent, complete reversal of severe treatment-resistant depression. The therapeutic potential of psychedelics is enormous so it‚Äôs important that the collective opinion of them catches up, and this is the book that can help you on the path toward a more open, nuanced, and critical view of it.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-happens-when-you-request-books">What Happens When You Request Books</h2>
<p>You may wonder, how can I influence my local library‚Äôs selection? Or, you may be unable to locate a specific book on bibliotek.dk. Write to your local library and ask if they will purchase it. The conditions for purchase are that it needs to be relatively new (a soft limit is later than 2021) and it‚Äôs more likely to be bought if the language is Danish. The librarian then asks the librarians at the central library if they think it makes sense to buy it. The central library is a large library that users don‚Äôt have direct access to, but which serves as a warehouse for several libraries.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Supporting our local libraries is more than a duty: it‚Äôs a privilege that allows us to shape the accessibility of knowledge in our communities. My experience of actively engaging with my library‚Äîrequesting books, exploring bibliotek.dk, and choosing physical books over ebooks‚Äîhas been incredibly rewarding. Libraries offer a treasure trove of resources that are just a few clicks away, and the impact of borrowing and requesting books is profound.</p>
<p>The books I've discovered have fundamentally changed my perspectives, proving that the right book at the right time can indeed alter the course of one‚Äôs life. By voting with our actions, we ensure that libraries continue to thrive and serve as vital centers of learning and community. Let's embrace our role in supporting these invaluable institutions. Whether through borrowing, requesting new books, or simply spreading the word, we have the power to keep our libraries vibrant and accessible for everyone.</p>
